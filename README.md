Time Calculation Javascript Library

If you have 3 projects in the running that took a significant amount of time  
and you wanted to know when these projects would be finished, what would you do?  
Oh and you have to take into account the weekends, vacation and holidays too ...

This is where Era.js can be of use. It creates a timeline for you with all the  
available data, splits the tasks and wraps them arround weekends and holidays.

With the calculated timeline coming from Era.js you now have estimated Start  
and End timings of your projects, taking work and non-work hours into account.
